<p>With the skills and knowledge you gain from studying programming, you will be able to build just about anything! Your creativity really is your limit. Whether you want to build a program that will help you quickly and easily rename and sort 5,000 newly downloaded photos from your overseas holiday, or you want to create a program that will keep track of your finances, as a programmer, you will be able to do it!
Programming is also an entrepreneur’s very best friend. Imagine taking your business ideas and making a website or an app that will help you to not only make them a reality, but market them as well!</p>
  <h3>Work remotely</h3>
  <p>As a freelance programmer you can work wherever you want: at home in your pyjamas, in a hotel room while travelling the world, from your favourite café, or in your car after an early morning surf. Working remotely gives you the freedom to choose when and where you work!</p>
  <h3>Mix and match careers</h3>
  <p>You can use your programming skills to compliment the work that you already do, or to follow a passion. For instance, if you are an accountant, you could write an accounting program that would make analysing accounts much easier. Or if you have a passion for writing and want to pen a novel, you could write a program that would make your novel interactive – adding an extra dimension for your readers to explore!</p>
